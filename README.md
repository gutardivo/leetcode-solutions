# LeetCode Solutions in TypeScript

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in TypeScript. Each problem 
is organized as a separate TypeScript file with an accompanying Jest test file for unit testing.

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

To set up the project, ensure you have **Node.js** installed, then run:

```sh
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies, including Jest for running tests.

## ðŸš€ Running Tests

To run all test cases, use:

```sh
npx jest
```

### âœ… Running Tests for a Specific Problem

To test a specific problem, such as **6-zigzag-conversion.ts**, run:

```sh
npx jest 6-zigzag-conversion.test.ts
```

This will execute tests only for the selected problem.

## ðŸ›  Project Structure

Each LeetCode problem follows this structure:

```

â”‚â”€LeetCode #6/
